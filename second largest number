Algorithm For Second Largest Number

Step 1: Initialize the array.
Step 2: Set the first two elements as the maximum and second maximum value.
Step 3: see to that value of max1 to be grater than max2, if not swap max1 and max2
Step 4: Iterate through the array strting from the third element and update the maximum 
        and second maximum values if we find a larger value.
Step 6: Print the second largest value.

FLOW CHART FOR FINDING THE SECOND LARGEST VALUE:

Start

Initialize array A

set max1 to A[0] and max2 to A[1]

if max1<max2 than

swap max1 and max2

End if

for i=2 to lenth of A-1 do

if A[i]>max1 than

max2=max1

max1=A[i]

else if a[i]>max2 than 

max2=a[i]

end if

end for 

print max2

end
